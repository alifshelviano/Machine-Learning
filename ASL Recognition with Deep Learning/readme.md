# ASL Recognition with Deep Learning


Stages

- **Objective:** Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters, laying the foundation for sign language translation technology.

- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Visualized ASL letters in the training dataset, providing insight into the dataset's composition and facilitating further analysis.

- **Dataset Analysis:** Examined the distribution of ASL letters in both the training and test datasets, ensuring a balanced representation of each letter.

- **One-Hot Encoding:** Utilized one-hot encoding to convert categorical integer labels into a format suitable for training a Keras model.

- **Model Definition and Training:** Defined and trained a CNN using Keras to predict the ASL letter from images, achieving high accuracy on the test set.
