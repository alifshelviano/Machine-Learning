# Sarcasm Detection on Headlines News


Stages

- **Data Acquisition and Cleaning:** Obtained a dataset of headlines, performed data cleaning, and removed duplicates to ensure a high-quality input for the model.

- **Preprocessing and Tokenization:** Applied natural language processing techniques, including tokenization and sequence padding, to convert textual data into a format suitable for machine learning.

- **Model Development:** Designed and implemented a sequential machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras, featuring LSTM layers for capturing contextual information and spatial dropout for robustness.

- **Training and Evaluation:** Trained the model on a split dataset, dedicating 80% for training and 20% for testing, achieving a successful accuracy rate of [your accuracy here]% on the test set.

- **Visualization and Insights:** Utilized visualizations such as word clouds and confusion matrices to gain insights into the characteristics of sarcastic and non-sarcastic headlines, providing a comprehensive analysis of the model's performance.
